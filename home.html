			Windows Mobile is a discontinued family of mobile operating systems developed by Microsoft for smartphones and Pocket PCs.[1]
Its origin dated back to Windows CE in 1996, though Windows Mobile itself first appeared in 2000 as Pocket PC 2000. It was renamed "Windows Mobile" in 2003, at which point it came in several versions (similar to the desktop versions of Windows) and was aimed at business and enterprise consumers. When initially released in the mid-2000s, it was to be the portable equivalent of what Windows ' desktop OS was; a major force in the then-emerging mobile/portable areas, but its popularity - always the low end of the market, never equalled nor surpassed other mobile OS' (iOS and Android), and faded rapidly in the following years
